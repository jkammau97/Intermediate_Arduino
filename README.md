[Files Referenced](led_fade)

This assignment is deceptively easy -- just make an LED fade off and on. The problem comes with using a new text editor -- Sublime. It's toolchain is very fickle, and will just not work sometimes. Either way I got it done in a timely manner.

#### Wiring

You literally just put a wire from a digital port with a ~ to an LED, then to ground.
Don't forget a 220 resistor, and that the short end is ground

#### Problems

None of great significance, besides the ~ port thing
